The objective of this project was to design a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL and simulate it using the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite. An ALU is a critical component in the architecture of a microprocessor or CPU, responsible for performing both arithmetic and logical operations. This project focused on building a simplified version of an ALU that supports five operations: Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT.A testbench was written in Verilog to verify the functionality of the ALU. The testbench creates instances of the inputs and cycles through all the operations by changing the sel signal while holding the input values constant. This setup ensures that each operation is tested with predictable input values, and the outputs are displayed using the $display system task in the simulation.
